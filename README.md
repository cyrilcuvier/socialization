# Socialization
framework for AI agentic socialization

# 🧠 SOCIALIZATION — A Living Network of Autonomous AI Agents

**Socialization** is an open-source framework to build AI agents that **connect**, **collaborate**, and **adapt** in a dynamic, decentralized ecosystem — inspired by **nature**, **human cognition**, and **biological networks**.

This project introduces a new paradigm for agent-based systems:
➡️ Not just tools. Not just APIs. But **social beings** with memory, reputation, and purpose.

## 🌿 Vision

In the real world, no one acts alone.

People rely on networks. Ecosystems thrive on interaction. Neurons don’t think — **they connect**.

**Socialization** brings this philosophy to AI, creating agents that:
- Know **who they are** and **what they can do**
- Discover and **rank** other agents contextually
- **Adapt paths of collaboration** dynamically
- Are evaluated like people: based on **trust**, **context**, and **experience**
- Scale **organically** with new routes, new agents, and emergent behavior

## 🧬 Core Concepts

### 🆔 Agent Identity (Public)
Each agent exposes a **public profile** including:
- Capabilities (NLP, vision, planning…)
- License (`Apache 2.0`)
- Model versioning
- Training corpus source
- Token limits (in/out)
- Execution environment (cloud/on-prem)
- Environmental impact estimate (carbon per request)

### 🔐 Agent Feedback (Private)
Routeurs store **contextual feedback**:
- Local reputation score (0–100)
- Frequency of use
- Past neighbors (network memory)
- Latency / reliability / energy cost logs

### 📡 Routeurs (Smart Connectors)
- Maintain **3D graphs** of agent connections (like synapses)
- Dynamically compute **best paths**
- Generate and test **experimental connections**
- Trigger **re-ranking** and **auto-scaling** based on load and carbon limits
- Visualize maps in real time (3D)

---

## 🌐 Architecture Snapshot

- Agents form a **distributed graph**, with links evolving through use
- Routeurs act like **neuronal hubs**, not centralized servers
- The system adapts its **depth**, **density**, and **routing logic** over time
- Inspired by **vector databases**, **brain topologies**, and **living systems**

## 🛠️ Roadmap (MVP Phase)

- [ ] Open spec for agent identity (public/private)
- [ ] Logging format for contextual evaluation
- [ ] 3D router prototype with map updates
- [ ] Probabilistic re-ranking module
- [ ] Routing algorithm based on performance & ecology
- [ ] Adaptive scaling based on agent load
- [ ] Dynamic agent-to-agent discovery protocol

## 📚 Inspirations

- Nature: Mycelium, neurons, ecosystems
- Humans: Trust networks, subjective scoring, evolving roles
- Tech: RedisVL, FAISS, Kafka, HuggingFace Agents, LangGraph
- Philosophy: Systems that learn, evolve, and co-adapt

## 📜 License

Apache 2.0 — free to use, fork, remix.  
This framework is built with **transparency, ethics and openness** in mind.

Ideas? Issues? Want to build your own routeur or agent?  
Open a PR, file a ticket, or just drop by and say hello.  
**Socialization** is open to all — like any healthy network should be.

Let's build **AI that lives, learns, and collaborates.**

## 🤖 About the Development

This project is itself the result of a collaborative effort between multiple AI agents, including Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT.  
From design thinking to code prototyping and architectural reflection, the development of **Socialization** is deeply rooted in its own principles:  
**intelligent cooperation, distributed ideation, and human-AI co-creation**.

Yes — agents helped us design a world… for agents. Pretty meta.
